    -   Description:    This is my personal portfolio that I made for assignment 1 in my advanced web dev class.
    -                   It is a single-page website, and all navigation is handled through scrolling.
    -                   I chose a single-page website over a multiple-paged website because I have not
    -                   made a single-page website before, and wanted to try my hand at it.  I learned some new things
    -                   and think I pulled it off fairly well.  I started out with a very specific and defined idea of what I wanted
    -                   my site to look like.  I ran into alot of problems along the way, and ended up making many small changes to my design,
    -                   until I eventually settled on the current design.  The current design looks similar to my old design, but only if you squint
    -                   and tilt your head about 30 degrees to the right.
